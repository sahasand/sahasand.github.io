    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Sandeep Saha, a biostatistician with a deep passion for turning complex clinical data into actionable insights. Numbers tell compelling stories, and my career is dedicated to uncovering these narratives, especially in clinical research.</p>

    <p>Born and raised in India, my professional journey has taken me across dynamic cities like Chicago, Toronto, and Boston, each offering unique experiences and opportunities for growth. Working with diverse and talented teams has not only sharpened my skills in biostatistics but has also profoundly enriched my perspective on collaboration and innovation.</p>

    <p>Travel fuels my curiosity about the world. I'm always excited to explore new destinations, immerse myself in local cultures, and connect with people from different backgrounds. From vibrant cityscapes to serene, hidden corners, each journey brings new inspiration and learning.</p>

    <p>Away from the data and travel, I'm a dedicated fan of the Green Bay Packers. Whether at Lambeau Field or watching from home, game days are always something I eagerly look forward to.</p>

    <p>Thank you for visiting my site. Here you'll discover highlights from my professional work, travel adventures, and maybe even a Packers update or two. Let's stay connectedâ€”I look forward to hearing from you!</p>
