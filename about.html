      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi there! My name is Sandeep Saha, and I'm a passionate biostatistician with an insatiable curiosity for the world around me. As someone who loves numbers and the stories they tell, I've dedicated my professional life to unraveling complex data and transforming it into valuable insights.</p>

      <p>I was born and raised in India, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics. I then set out on a global journey that has taken me to the bustling cities of Chicago, Toronto, and Boston. Along the way, I've had the privilege of working with incredible teams, each of which has contributed to my growth as a professional and as a person.</p>
  
      <p>When I'm not crunching numbers, I'm usually on the move, exploring new destinations and immersing myself in the local culture. Traveling has broadened my horizons and given me a deep appreciation for the beauty and diversity of our world. I'm also an ardent fan of the Green Bay Packers, and you can often find me cheering them on, whether from the stands or from the comfort of my living room.</p>
  
      <p>Life in Chicago, Toronto, and Boston has been a thrilling adventure, with each city leaving an indelible mark on my heart. I've made lasting friendships, discovered new passions, and built a career that I'm truly proud of. While my ties to India remain strong, I'm excited to continue my journey, embracing the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.</p>
  
      <p>Thank you for stopping by and getting to know me a little better. I hope you enjoy exploring my website, where I share my work, travels, and love for the Green Bay Packers. Let's stay connected!</p>
